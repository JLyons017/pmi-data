							<p>To carry out the survey of this study, the firm survey built a panel that represents the underlying structure of each sector in the economy according to its contribution to the gross value added. Companies are classified into small, medium, and large. Small companies have between 1 and 19 employees, medium companies have between 20 and 249 employees, and large companies have over 250 employees.</p>
							<p>The sector classification of companies is based on the ISIC divisions, and the survey considers companies from the manufacturing sector and the service sector. Within the manufacturing sector, companies are classified into Food & Drink, Textiles & Clothing, Electrical, Chemicals & Plastics, Transport, Timber & Paper, Basic Metals, Mechanical Engineering, and Other Manufacturing. Within the services sector, the companies are classified into Hotels & Restaurants, Transport & Storage, Post & Telecommunication, Financial Intermediation, Renting & Business Activities, and Other Services.</p>
							<p>The expansion factors used by the firm survey were not provided to the researchers, so it was necessary to perform a reverse-engineering process to build weights that make the survey representative at the gross-value-added level. The distribution of economic data by company size and industry was obtained from the Census Bureau's Statistics of US Businesses (SUSB). It has variables such as number of firms, number of establishments, employment, and annual payroll. The data are grouped by geographic area, industry, and employment size of the enterprise. The sector classification is based on the 2012 North American Industry Classification System (NAICS).<sup>1</sup></p>
							<p>As our survey uses the ISIC classification while the national distribution provided by the statistical offices uses the NAICS classification, it was necessary to make a concordance between both industrial classification systems.<sup>2</sup> Table 1 provides detailed descriptions of the concordance between classification systems.</p>
							<p>Finally, our surveyâ€™s companies and the Census Bureau companies were classified into 7 categories: Manufacturing, Hotels & Restaurants, Transport & Storage, Post & Telecommunication, Financial Intermediation, Renting & Business Activities, and Other Services. According to the number of employees, companies are classified into small (between 1 and 19 employees), medium (between 20 and 249 employees), and large (over 250 employees), so 21 weights were built in total.</p>
							<p>As the purpose of the firm survey is to obtain a representative sample of companies in order to reveal the contribution that each sector makes to overall gross value added, weights were built to make our survey representative of the annual payroll distribution observed in national accounts, understanding payroll as a proxy of gross value added. The weights by economic sector and company size were calculated as the ratio between the fraction of payroll in national accounts and the fraction of firms belonging to that classification in the survey.</p>

							<p>Table 2 shows in detail the weights-building process. The annual payroll was calculated by economic sector and company size (column (1)). Then, the fraction of annual payroll over the total was calculated (column (2)). On the other hand, the fraction of companies in the survey belonging to each classification was determined (column (4)). The weight was calculated by dividing (2) into (4).</p>
